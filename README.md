# Herbrand's unification theorem for flows

This repo contains (at the moment) a proof of Herbrand's [1] unification theorem [2] for flows [3] [4].

I am interested in formalizing *flows* [3] [4], which are object that allow to present low-level computations in a satisfactory way (up to my understanding).
The first step towards this goal is the theorem that I proved here.

The project is more of a speedrun of the theorem at the moment. It took me about two weeks (I'd say I spend 50% of my time on the actual theorem and the other 50% on groundwork).

Now that the theorem is proven, there is some cleaning to do in the files (to make them look less speedrun-y...):

 * Split and reorganize the files
 * Automate the proof !
 * Extract the computational part from the theorem (I want to be able to automatically get a unifier)
 * Commit to [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) ?

## Development

I am working on making properties decidable (the goal is to prove equalities of flow multiplications by `decide` or by a simple tactic).

At the moment, the inclusion on `Fintype` is decidable:
```lean
example : 0 ‚àà (ùí± (Term.Cons (Term.Var 0) (Term.Var 1) : Term Nat Nat) : Fintype Nat) := by
  decide
```
